# RoadTo99

RoadTo99 is a tool that retrieves your hiscore from Old School Runescape and stores them as a point in time. This allows players to view their characters in the past and compare skill gains across different time periods, as well as with different characters. 

## Future Plans

- Create skill calculators to plan items and actions needed to achieve a certain level.
- Connect to the Grand Exchange database to retrieve item prices.
  - Set up a daily task to refresh item prices and store the previous day's for future access.
  - Create High Alchemy Calculator based on data retrieved from Grand Exchange.
- Create dashboards to allow players to customise their home page with the stats they want to see. 
- TBC...
